<p><strong>Ride With GPS Links</strong></p>
<p>Day 1 - <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/R1xoUf5f77RWbPW6A">Whiting ME to Lubec ME - navigated with Google Maps only</a></p>
<p>Day 2 - <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/40179263">Lubec ME to St. Andrews NB</a></p>
<p>Day 3 - <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/40181261">St. Andrews NB to Calais ME</a></p>
<p>In late July, I quit my job at the MAPC (a wonderful organization and colleagues!!) and joined the IBI Group as a Transportation Planner and Transit Data Analyst. In the few days I had between these two jobs, I decided to complete an item on my bucket list - crossing an international border on my bike! I had initially thought of biking from Burlington VT to Montreal - and complete the final segment of the original Bostreal. However, the complex logistics and high cost of that trip made me shelve that. I realized that I could alternatively bike from Lubec ME! While I had thought doing a longer trip from Lubec to Halifax (mix of bike, ferry, and bus) due to the limited time, I decided on a shorter trip.</p>
<p>Lubec was a good choice. I had already been there the year before with a friend, and I had really liked the town. Back then, the border was closed due to COVID restrictions, and now I was finally going to be able to cross!</p>

<p>This ride, just like the Connecticut River Connect, from Brattleboro to Greenfield was not part of the ride351 challenge. However, it was, just like that ride - a very amazing bike trip. Lubec is very far from Boston. It took me 3 buses, and an entire day to just get there. In short, I took the <a href="https://concordcoachlines.com/">Concord Coach</a> bus from Boston to Bangor, and then <a href="http://www.westbusservice.com/">West Bus Service</a> from Bangor to Whiting - from where I biked to Lubec. Do note, that West Bus Service takes cash only, which has to be paid at the Concord Coach station in Bangor, and extra for bikes. Please confirm by phone before you go. Concord Coach tickets can be bought online on their website.</p>

<h3><em>Day 1 - Whiting ME to Lubec ME</em></h3>
<p>The bus ride from Boston to Whiting took three changes, with a two-hour layover in Bangor. The Bangor bus terminal is in the middle of a strip-mall area. Absolutely not nice, but its fine. Concord Coach buses were the regular tour buses, but West Bus Service buses are just large minivans. There tend to be not more than 3-4 passengers. The entire journey from Boston to Whiting takes about 9 hours, and the bus drops you off at Whiting at about 5pm. From there, its about 11 miles on bike to Lubec.</p>

<p>Lubec lies on a small peninsula, jutting out into the waters of the Bay of Fundy. This gives it a San Fransisco like quality and has its own highly distinct micro-climate. The rest of New England was going through a heatwave, with temperatures in the mid to upper 80s. Lubec was a cool 65. This also results in a lot of fog! It was extremely interesting to start in hot weather in Whiting, and - just 11 miles away, shivering.</p>

<p>I stayed at Cohill’s Inn for the night. While not the cheapest option, I was on a bit of a vacation, so thought of spending more than I would’ve otherwise. When the innkeeper realized that I was biking into Canada, he even gave me a beer on the house! He definitely has me as a customer for life.</p>

<h3><em>Day 2 - Lubec ME to St. Andrews NB</em></h3>
<p>This day, I was finally going to cross the US-Canada border on a bike! I was so excited, it is beyond ridiculous. It was a foggy morning, as it often is in Lubec, and I was worried that it might rain - but it did not.</p>

<p>New Brunswick is on the Atlantic Time Zone, which is one hour ahead of Eastern Time Zone - which Maine is in. My phone had already switched to the Atlantic Time Zone, while my watch was still in Eastern. This helped me keep track of times in both sides of the border. I had timed my departure time keeping in mind the ferry times. I was going to take two ferries today - the first one from Campobello Island to Deer Island, and then another one from Deer Island to the mainland at L’Etete. Schedules to both ferries are listed <a href="http://deerisland.nb.ca/ferries.htm">here</a>. Campobello-Deer island ferry is every hour from 9 am to 7 pm, and between Deer island and L’Etete is every thirty minutes from 8 am to 5pm. There are ferries outside these hours too, but at reduced frequencies.</p>
<p>My border formalities happened only on the Canadian side. While crossing between the US and Canada, you only need to do this at the border office of the country you are entering. The road from the border to the ferry point is not the nicest. It’s far too wide and has a long slow gruelling climb. It took me a little longer than anticipated, and the ferry had just left when I got there, so I chilled on the docks.</p>

<p>Deer island was filled with small, low traffic hilly roads, and it was really nice. I had timed my ride to ideally stop at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ocean+view+takeout/@45.0083885,-66.9403911,15.24z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4ca8a1df33626b2f:0x1e7a9123ab5e4834!8m2!3d45.0078878!4d-66.9422936">Ocean View Takeout</a> in time for lunch. But because my initial ferry was later than expected, I got there at peak lunch time, so of course there was a wait. But the food was worth the wait.</p>
