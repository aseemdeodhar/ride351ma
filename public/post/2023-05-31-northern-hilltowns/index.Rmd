The northern Berkshire Hills area, followed by the northern half of the Pioneer Valley is probably my favorite place to ride in all of Massachusetts. There are enough low- to no-stress roads here that aren't as isolating as rail-trails. Despite the steep hilly roads, it is really peaceful to ride here.

One of my most favorite rides - [the towns north of Route 2](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2022-08-21-rural-ridin/) - was also the most hilly ride I've ever done in Massachusetts.

Overall, I covered 8 new towns - Groveland, Haverhill, Amesbury, Merrimac, West Newbury, Georgetown, Andover, and North Andover - bringing the total to 283/351 - 80.6%!
