The northern Berkshire Hills area, followed by the northern half of the Pioneer Valley is probably my favorite place to ride in all of Massachusetts. There are enough low- to no-stress roads here that aren't as isolating as rail-trails. Despite the steep hilly roads, it is really peaceful to ride here, and I have only had positive experiences with. I have started/ended countless rides in Greenfield and Northampton - both very nice towns to spend time in.

One of my most favorite rides - [**the towns north of Route 2**](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2022-08-21-rural-ridin/) - was also the most hilly ride I've ever done in Massachusetts.

### Day 1 - Greenfield to Worthington

For this ride, I started by taking the Amtrak Vermonter train from Essex Junction VT to Greenfield MA. I was accompanying the [*2023 Bostreal*](https://bostoncyclistsunion.org/bostreal) group as a support volunteer. I had previously ridden with them during the [2021 ride](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2022-04-23-bostreal-day-1/). As mentioned in the [*Trip Planning*](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2023-12-31-trip-planning/#transportation-to-and-from-the-ride) guide, Amtrak allows bicycles on this train with pre-booking.

The Vermonter train goes along the Connecticut River, and has some incredible views. I've taken it once in fall, and the views were incredible. You can catch a glimpse of the Cornish-Windsor covered bridge, which is the second-longest covered bridge in the US (used to be the longest).

The ride today consisted of a nearly 1,500 foot climb, nearly consistently uphill for 15 miles, after an initial 5 miles in the flat northern Pioneer Valley through Deerfield. I had previously only skirted the southern portion of Deerfield on the [Mohawk Trail](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2022-04-23-the-mohawk-trail/) ride, and twice along the northern edge after crossing over from Montague on the Canalside Rail Trail Bridge (See [Connecticut River Connect](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2022-10-15-connecticut-river-connect/) and [A Wedding with a side of Covid](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2022-05-29-a-wedding/)). This time, however, I rode right through the main part of the historic town. Unfortunately I do not have good pictures, but it was a picturesque farming town with a nice shaded main street. While the road wasn't a narrow rural road, it had very few vehicles - a feature of the northern Berkshire Hills and Pioneer Valley I love.

##### Conway

I have passed through the town of Conway, and had a snack/water break at the Conway General Store three times so far. It has become my favorite place to stop. It is a very basic, simple general store with the basics, but they have a small bike rack with some space to sit and eat. This time, however, was the first time I was going beyond Conway along Route 116W, and not to or from Shelburne Falls. I also came across a small covered bridge right after the store. Conway remains a favorite town to pass through.

Overall, I covered 11 new towns - Cheshire, Worthington, Cummington, Peru, Plainfield, Dalton, Windsor, Hinsdale, Savoy, Adams, and Washington - bringing the total to 296/351 - 84.3%!
