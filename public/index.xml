      <description>Ride With GPS Links
Day 1 - Worcester to Orange
Day 2 - Orange to Greenfield
This ride was the result of a friend’s wedding out in Montague. I immediately used this opportunity to cover towns in the central portion of Massachusetts, between the Quabbin and Worcester. These towns are notoriously lacking any reliable transportation options, so I knew this was going to be a long bike ride.
For the wedding, we had booked an Airbnb in Orange, MA.</description>

      <description>Ride With GPS Links
Day 1 - Providence to New Bedford
Day 2 - New Bedford to Bourne
This ride was the result of mainland Massachusetts anticipating a massive rise in temperatures - 95° F and beyond. The South Coast was supposed to not bear this brunt. As such, I planned a two-day route - first from Providence to New Bedford, and then New Bedford to Bourne with a day-trip out to Cuttyhunk - the only publicly accessible of the Elizabeth Islands which make up the municipality of Gosnold.</description>

      <description>This was a very short ride, about 18 miles (30 km) starting from North Billerica station, and ending at the Black Horse Tavern in Winchester center. Apart from being a blisteringly hot day - the first near 90° F (32° C) day since winter, it was a generally pleasant ride. The suburban towns of Billerica, Wilmington, Woburn, Burlington, Winchester, and Tewksbury had easy to ride on interconnected side streets - something I value a lot about living in Boston.</description>

      <description>Ride With GPS Links
Day 1 - Amherst to North Adams
Day 2 - North Adams to Lenox
In September 2021, I rode along Route 2 (The Mohawk Trail) starting from Amherst, and ending at North Adams. This was a pivotal ride - one that made me realize I had covered a very decent amount of the state by bike. This ride was also prompted by my successful completion of the four-day Bostreal ride, where I rode with a group of passionate biking folks from Boston to the North Hero islands in Vermont.</description>

      <description>You can call this my first taste of biking longer distances (read 50+ miles). In August 2021, I rode with an incredible group of 25 people from Boston, MA to North Hero Islands, VT. This journey of close to 400 km took place across 5 days. While I am documenting only the section of the ride within Massachusetts for now, I will create a dedicated post for the entire Bostreal route.</description>
