 Bourne to Woods Hole Martha&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard: Vineyard Haven to HI Hostel Martha&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard: HI Hostel to Oak Bluffs Nantucket Loop  This was a long awaited trip - in the nearly five years of living in Boston, I had never been to the islands. The first island I went to was Cuttyhunk in May 2022! Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve ridden my bike on the Cape multiple times, I have always had a very bad experience riding in the Upper and Mid Cape.</description>

The northern Berkshire Hills area, followed by the northern half of the Pioneer Valley is probably my favorite place to ride in all of Massachusetts. There are enough low- to no-stress roads here that aren&amp;rsquo;t as isolating as rail-trails. Despite the steep hilly roads, it is really peaceful to ride here, and I have only had positive experiences with.</description>

It was the perfect May day with clear sunny skies and crisp cool-warm temperatures. Leaves were still fresh green, and overall the perfect Boston spring day. My ride started from the Andover Commuter Rail Station and passed through Andover town center, and the infamous Elm Square intersection, where just three days earlier, a child was fatally struck by the driver of a tractor-trailer. The intersection has long been considered dangerous, but town officials have only now started taking it seriously - a reminder of how fatalities are often required to wake up authorities.</description>

Another warm-ish day in February. We don&amp;rsquo;t waste those in this part of the world. This ride was a combination of two shorter rides. The route was nice, with no/low traffic, and went through some residential streets, and low-traffic connector roads. After crossing I-95, it became less bedroom-community-ish, and more classic North-Shore village like atmosphere. Towards the end, however, it becomes a little hilly along a busy-ish road and an intersection with 128, but ends at Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea!</description>

January and February are the coldest months in Boston with temperatures rarely above freezing, let alone warm enough to ride a bike. The day before this ride New England experienced extremely frigid temperatures due to a polar vortex. Literally overnight, temperatures soared from 17 F to 50 F daytime maximum. Such temperature swings are not unheard of here. With such a nice sunny, (relatively) warm Sunday, I decided to set off on a ride!</description>

Dedham to Weymouth
If you thought the last ride from Attleboro to Plymouth was bad - I have worse news for you. This section of the state is terribl-er. The entire route I was battling SUVs and pick-up trucks. It was a series of long stretches of stroads only. This ride had only one redeemable section - which unfortunately was also uphill. I highly recommend not riding this section unless you’re doing something as daft as biking all across the state.</description>

Attleboro to Plymouth
After a long time riding out west in the Berkshires, this was the first time in a long time I was riding in the Boston area. I was dreading this portion of the region - and rightfully so. The suburban, car-centric development in this part of the state leaves a lot to be desired, and it was relatively hostile environment to bike in.</description>

This was one of the few rides I did that I drove to. Well, my friend drove us and our bikes to. These towns are served by the WRTA 33 and 19 routes, which I would&amp;rsquo;ve taken had I gone alone. It was a beautiful early November/late Fall day with the bright fall colors slowing down from the October riot. With partially clear skies, the landscape was dominated by blue, brown, and deep golden-brown.</description>

Bellows Falls to Greenfield
This ride was not part of my ride351 challenge. It was peak fall colors season in this part of Vermont and Massachusetts, so I decided to rent a car (I know, booo!) and drive up to Bellows Falls. While my original plan was to ride from Bellows Falls to Greenfield and take the Amtrak back up, I realized that I might not make it in time, so decided to cut the ride short, and drove down to Brattleboro and started from there.</description>

Day 1 - Pittsfield to Great Barrington
Day 2 - Great Barrington to Springfield
Similar to my ride from Lee to Northampton, I had to take a bus from Boston to the Berkshires (this time to Pittsfield) via Springfield. This bus arrives relatively late in the day, around 2:30/3pm, so I had a very short amount of day-light hours to bike. This ride was in two parts again, first from Pittsfield to Great Barrington, where I would spend the night, and then the next day along Route 57 along the Connecticut Frontier.</description>

Day 1 - Greenfield to Shelburne Falls
Day 2 - Shelburne Falls to Northampton
As mentioned in my previous post, I both enjoy, and dread a cross-Berkshire hills ride. For this one ride, I had a massive 1200’ uphill climb over 5 miles, with no place to stop for refreshments until the very peak of the climb. This was the path of least resistance to cover these rural towns.</description>

In late July, I quit my job at the MAPC (a wonderful organization and colleagues!!) and joined the IBI Group as a Transportation Planner and Transit Data Analyst. In the few days I had between these two jobs, I decided to complete an item on my bucket list - crossing an international border on my bike!</description>

Day 1 - Lee to Northampton
Day 2 - Northampton to Springfield
I both enjoy, and dread a cross-Berkshire hills ride. The roads and views are fantastic, as are the downhills, but the uphill portions can be dreadful. Generally speaking, going from west to east incurs lower uphill climbs, as the Berkshire valley is higher in elevation than the Pioneer valley. However, as I am limited on transportation options, finding easy transportation to towns in the Berkshire valley is difficult and time-consuming.</description>

Day 1 - Worcester to Orange
Day 2 - Orange to Greenfield
This ride was the result of a friend’s wedding out in Montague. I immediately used this opportunity to cover towns in the central portion of Massachusetts, between the Quabbin and Worcester. These towns are notoriously lacking any reliable transportation options, so I knew this was going to be a long bike ride.
For the wedding, we had booked an Airbnb in Orange, MA.</description>

Day 1 - Providence to New Bedford
Day 2 - New Bedford to Bourne
This ride was the result of mainland Massachusetts anticipating a massive rise in temperatures - 95° F and beyond. The South Coast was supposed to not bear this brunt. As such, I planned a two-day route - first from Providence to New Bedford, and then New Bedford to Bourne with a day-trip out to Cuttyhunk - the only publicly accessible of the Elizabeth Islands which make up the municipality of Gosnold.</description>

      <description>This was a very short ride, about 18 miles (30 km) starting from North Billerica station, and ending at the Black Horse Tavern in Winchester center. Apart from being a blisteringly hot day - the first near 90° F (32° C) day since winter, it was a generally pleasant ride. The suburban towns of Billerica, Wilmington, Woburn, Burlington, Winchester, and Tewksbury had easy to ride on interconnected side streets - something I value a lot about living in Boston.</description>

      <description>I first started getting into planning my bike rides beyond just - &amp;ldquo;Enter start and end points on Google Maps and GO!&amp;rdquo; after my Bos/treal (check it out!!) ride in 2021. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered a list of resources which I have used, and some I haven&amp;rsquo;t, but come recommended! Note: None of the links are sponsored. I do not get any commission if you click on these links.
To give an overview, the following points are a good gist of what to think of when trip planning.</description>

Day 1 - Amherst to North Adams
Day 2 - North Adams to Lenox
In September 2021, I rode along Route 2 (The Mohawk Trail) starting from Amherst, and ending at North Adams. This was a pivotal ride - one that made me realize I had covered a very decent amount of the state by bike. This ride was also prompted by my successful completion of the four-day Bostreal ride, where I rode with a group of passionate biking folks from Boston to the North Hero islands in Vermont.</description>

      <description>You can call this my first taste of biking longer distances (read 50+ miles). In August 2021, I rode with an incredible group of 25 people from Boston, MA to North Hero Islands, VT. This journey of close to 400 km took place across 5 days. While I am documenting only the section of the ride within Massachusetts for now, I will create a dedicated post for the entire Bostreal route.</description>
