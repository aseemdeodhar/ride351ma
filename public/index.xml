Dedham to Weymouth
If you thought the last ride from Attleboro to Plymouth was bad - I have worse news for you. This section of the state is terribl-er. The entire route I was battling SUVs and pick-up trucks. It was a series of long stretches of stroads only. This ride had only one redeemable section - which unfortunately was also uphill. I highly recommend not riding this section unless you’re doing something as daft as biking all across the state.</description>

Attleboro to Plymouth
After a long time riding out west in the Berkshires, this was the first time in a long time I was riding in the Boston area. I was dreading this portion of the region - and rightfully so. The suburban, car-centric development in this part of the state leaves a lot to be desired, and it was relatively hostile environment to bike in.</description>

Bellows Falls to Greenfield
This ride was not part of my ride351 challenge. It was peak fall colors season in this part of Vermont and Massachusetts, so I decided to rent a car (I know, booo!) and drive up to Bellows Falls. While my original plan was to ride from Bellows Falls to Greenfield and take the Amtrak back up, I realized that I might not make it in time, so decided to cut the ride short, and drove down to Brattleboro and started from there.</description>

Day 1 - Pittsfield to Great Barrington
Day 2 - Great Barrington to Springfield
Similar to my ride from Lee to Northampton, I had to take a bus from Boston to the Berkshires (this time to Pittsfield) via Springfield. This bus arrives relatively late in the day, around 2:30/3pm, so I had a very short amount of day-light hours to bike. This ride was in two parts again, first from Pittsfield to Great Barrington, where I would spend the night, and then the next day along Route 57 along the Connecticut Frontier.</description>

Day 1 - Greenfield to Shelburne Falls
Day 2 - Shelburne Falls to Northampton
As mentioned in my previous post, I both enjoy, and dread a cross-Berkshire hills ride. For this one ride, I had a massive 1200’ uphill climb over 5 miles, with no place to stop for refreshments until the very peak of the climb. This was the path of least resistance to cover these rural towns.</description>

Day 1 - Lee to Northampton
Day 2 - Northampton to Springfield
I both enjoy, and dread a cross-Berkshire hills ride. The roads and views are fantastic, as are the downhills, but the uphill portions can be dreadful. Generally speaking, going from west to east incurs lower uphill climbs, as the Berkshire valley is higher in elevation than the Pioneer valley. However, as I am limited on transportation options, finding easy transportation to towns in the Berkshire valley is difficult and time-consuming.</description>

Day 1 - Worcester to Orange
Day 2 - Orange to Greenfield
This ride was the result of a friend’s wedding out in Montague. I immediately used this opportunity to cover towns in the central portion of Massachusetts, between the Quabbin and Worcester. These towns are notoriously lacking any reliable transportation options, so I knew this was going to be a long bike ride.
For the wedding, we had booked an Airbnb in Orange, MA.</description>

Day 1 - Providence to New Bedford
Day 2 - New Bedford to Bourne
This ride was the result of mainland Massachusetts anticipating a massive rise in temperatures - 95° F and beyond. The South Coast was supposed to not bear this brunt. As such, I planned a two-day route - first from Providence to New Bedford, and then New Bedford to Bourne with a day-trip out to Cuttyhunk - the only publicly accessible of the Elizabeth Islands which make up the municipality of Gosnold.</description>

      <description>This was a very short ride, about 18 miles (30 km) starting from North Billerica station, and ending at the Black Horse Tavern in Winchester center. Apart from being a blisteringly hot day - the first near 90° F (32° C) day since winter, it was a generally pleasant ride. The suburban towns of Billerica, Wilmington, Woburn, Burlington, Winchester, and Tewksbury had easy to ride on interconnected side streets - something I value a lot about living in Boston.</description>

Day 1 - Amherst to North Adams
Day 2 - North Adams to Lenox
In September 2021, I rode along Route 2 (The Mohawk Trail) starting from Amherst, and ending at North Adams. This was a pivotal ride - one that made me realize I had covered a very decent amount of the state by bike. This ride was also prompted by my successful completion of the four-day Bostreal ride, where I rode with a group of passionate biking folks from Boston to the North Hero islands in Vermont.</description>

      <description>You can call this my first taste of biking longer distances (read 50+ miles). In August 2021, I rode with an incredible group of 25 people from Boston, MA to North Hero Islands, VT. This journey of close to 400 km took place across 5 days. While I am documenting only the section of the ride within Massachusetts for now, I will create a dedicated post for the entire Bostreal route.</description>
