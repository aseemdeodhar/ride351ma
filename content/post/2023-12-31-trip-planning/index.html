<p>I first started getting into planning my bike rides beyond just - “Enter start and end points on Google Maps and GO!” after my <a href="https://bostoncyclistsunion.org/bostreal">Bos/treal (check it out!!)</a> ride in 2021. Since then, I’ve gathered a list of resources which I have used, and some I haven’t, but come recommended! <strong>Note: None of the links are sponsored. I do not get any commission if you click on these links.</strong></p>
<p>To give an overview, the following points are a good gist of what to think of when trip planning. I have detailed each section further down as well. I am always happy to answer any questions you may have, and offer help, advice, and suggestions <strong>AT ABSOLUTELY NO MONETARY COST</strong>. I was the recipient of all of this information because of generous help from others, and I wish that you get it at no cost as well!</p>
