You can call this my first taste of biking longer distances (read 50+ miles). In August 2021, I rode with an incredible group of 25 people from Boston, MA to North Hero Islands, VT. This journey of close to 400 km  took place across 5 days. While I am documenting only the section of the ride within Massachusetts for now, I will create a dedicated post for the entire Bostreal route.

The Bostreal ride is organized by the amazing people and volunteers at the [Boston Cyclists Union](https://bostoncyclistsunion.org/) - a mobility justice advocacy group based in Boston. Through their organizing, they have helped transform Boston and the surrounding areas into one of the safest biking cities in North America.

This ride took me through 18 different towns and cities, starting from Boston and ending in Templeton.
