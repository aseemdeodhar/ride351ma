This was a long awaited trip - in the nearly five years of living in Boston, I had never been to the islands. The first island I went to was [Cuttyhunk](https://ride351ma.bike/post/2022-05-23-south-coast-ing/) in May 2022! Even though I've ridden my bike on the Cape multiple times, I have always had a very bad experience riding in the Upper and Mid Cape. This is definitely anecdotal, but the most hostility I've faced in Massachusetts (and the only hostility that really affected me) was on the Cape. The Outer Cape is fine though, and I've only had friendly experiences.

We started our journey by taking an early morning [P&B Bus](https://www.p-b.com/schedules/) from Boston South Station to the [Sagamore Park & Ride](https://goo.gl/maps/38CzzmXaiYkChSkFA). From here, we rode down to Wood's Hole to catch our ferry to Martha's Vineyard. This ride was relatively uneventful - this part of the Cape is not unlike the suburban areas of Boston. Until we hit the Shining Seas bike path in Falmouth, it was mostly narrow, but heavily trafficked roads. The weather was very high humidity, so we were drenched by the time we got to the Wood's Hole Ferry Terminal.

Shining Seas bike path was nice, if crowded. It went right by the coast - and would have felt brilliant if it was sunny and cool. However, the cloudy and slightly foggy weather had its charm too.

Overall, I covered 10 new towns - Aquinnah, Nantucket, West Tisbury, Sandwich, Edgartown, Oak Bluffs, Tisbury, Falmouth, Mashpee, and Chilmark - bringing the total to 312/351 - 88.9%!
