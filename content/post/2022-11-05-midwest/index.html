<p>If you thought the last ride from Attleboro to Plymouth was bad - I have worse news for you. This section of the state is terribl-er. The entire route I was battling SUVs and pick-up trucks. It was a series of long stretches of stroads only. This ride had only one redeemable section - which unfortunately was also uphill. I highly recommend not riding this section unless youâ€™re doing something as daft as biking all across the state.</p>
