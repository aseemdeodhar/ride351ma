**Ride With GPS Links**

Day 1 - [Worcester to Orange](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39535251)

Day 2 - [Orange to Greenfield](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39536726)

This ride was the result of a friend's wedding out in Montague. I immediately used this opportunity to cover towns in the central portion of Massachusetts, between the Quabbin and Worcester. These towns are notoriously lacking any reliable transportation options, so I knew this was going to be a long bike ride.

For the wedding, we had booked an Airbnb in Orange, MA. As such, I planned a ride starting from Worcester to Orange, along the northern and eastern portions of the Quabbin Reservoir. Highly remote, this part of the state generally seems to be off-the-beaten trail. A 'here be dragons' feel, if you will. I got some really nice rural farmland scenery along the way.

The second portion of the ride was from Orange to Greenfield, from where I was going to take an Amtrak train to Springfield to connect to a PeterPan bus back home to Boston.

I took the first train out of Boston heading towards Worcester. For a 51 mile ride, I decided on giving it about 6 and a half hours. My thumb-rule for calculating ride duration including stops is 1 hour for every 10 miles, and an additional hour for every 30 miles. This works out most times. Of course, terrain, weather, and the possibility of stops affects this.

### *Worcester to Barre*

The ride out of Worcester, was to my lunch stop in Barre. This was a long, moderate uphill climb, but had some rewarding views of the Holden Reservoir. My lunch stop was at a pie place (now called ['Cafe on the Common'](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cafe+on+the+Common/@42.4226861,-72.106959,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e153b6bbcd67e9:0xc294a806d25c9da!8m2!3d42.4227653!4d-72.1060912)) in Barre. They had just opened up and had some excellent pies.

I finally arrived in Orange in the afternoon, a couple of hours before the rest of my party was supposed to arrive. I was able to freshen up before heading out to the wedding.

### *Orange to Greenfield*

Even though this was the shorter portion of the ride, and I had a tight end-point (had to catch the 9am train to Springfield!), it was filled with dramatic views and climbs & descents. It was incredibly misty for the first half of the ride. I started from Orange, climbed up to Wendell, and then descended towards Erving. The portion of Route 2 until Erving is off-limits to bikes, so had to ride via Wendell.

After descending from Wendell, I biked along Route 2 over the French King Bridge! I had driven along it in Fall 2021, and was determined to bike across. It was absolutely stunning!

With just under 45 minutes left before I had to catch my train from Greenfield, the next portion of the ride was a rush. I made it just in time, and was able to get a couple of pictures of the newly renovated [John W. Olver Transit Center, Greenfield MA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Greenfield/@42.5857342,-72.6002315,17.95z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e12f38789ed3cf:0x14c4a4bec452f862!8m2!3d42.585889!4d-72.6006969!5m1!1e4).

The unfortunate outcome of the wedding was, a lot of people including me caught COVID - thankfully it was mild for everyone thanks to vaccinations.

Overall, I covered 15 new towns - Barre, Erving, Holden, Phillipston, Rutland, Petersham, Paxton, Greenfield, Worcester, Hubbardston, Oakham, Gill, Montague, Wendell, and New Salem - bringing the total to 167/351.
