<p><strong>Ride With GPS Links</strong></p>
<p>Day 1 - <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39535251">Worcester to Orange</a></p>
<p>Day 2 - <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/39536726">Orange to Greenfield</a></p>
<p>This ride was the result of a friend’s wedding out in Montague. I immediately used this opportunity to cover towns in the central portion of Massachusetts, between the Quabbin and Worcester. These towns are notoriously lacking any reliable transportation options, so I knew this was going to be a long bike ride.</p>
<p>For the wedding, we had booked an Airbnb in Orange, MA. As such, I planned a ride starting from Worcester to Orange, along the northern and eastern portions of the Quabbin Reservoir. Highly remote, this part of the state generally seems to be off-the-beaten trail. A ‘here be dragons’ feel, if you will. I got some really nice rural farmland scenery along the way.</p>
<p>The second portion of the ride was from Orange to Greenfield, from where I was going to take an Amtrak train to Springfield to connect to a PeterPan bus back home to Boston.</p>

<p>I took the first train out of Boston heading towards Worcester. For a 51 mile ride, I decided on giving it about 6 and a half hours. My thumb-rule for calculating ride duration including stops is 1 hour for every 10 miles, and an additional hour for every 30 miles. This works out most times. Of course, terrain, weather, and the possibility of stops affects this.</p>

<p>The ride out of Worcester, was to my lunch stop in Barre. This was a long, moderate uphill climb, but had some rewarding views of the Holden Reservoir. My lunch stop was at a pie place (now called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cafe+on+the+Common/@42.4226861,-72.106959,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e153b6bbcd67e9:0xc294a806d25c9da!8m2!3d42.4227653!4d-72.1060912">‘Cafe on the Common’</a>) in Barre. They had just opened up and had some excellent pies.</p>

<p>I finally arrived in Orange in the afternoon, a couple of hours before the rest of my party was supposed to arrive. I was able to freshen up before heading out to the wedding.</p>

<p>Even though this was the shorter portion of the ride, and I had a tight end-point (had to catch the 9am train to Springfield!), it was filled with dramatic views and climbs &amp; descents. It was incredibly misty for the first half of the ride. I started from Orange, climbed up to Wendell, and then descended towards Erving. The portion of Route 2 until Erving is off-limits to bikes, so had to ride via Wendell.</p>

<p>After descending from Wendell, I biked along Route 2 over the French King Bridge! I had driven along it in Fall 2021, and was determined to bike across. It was absolutely stunning!</p>

<p>With just under 45 minutes left before I had to catch my train from Greenfield, the next portion of the ride was a rush. I made it just in time, and was able to get a couple of pictures of the newly renovated <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Greenfield/@42.5857342,-72.6002315,17.95z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e12f38789ed3cf:0x14c4a4bec452f862!8m2!3d42.585889!4d-72.6006969!5m1!1e4">John W.

<p>The unfortunate outcome of the wedding was, a lot of people including me caught COVID - thankfully it was mild for everyone thanks to vaccinations.</p>
<p>Overall, I covered 15 new towns - Barre, Erving, Holden, Phillipston, Rutland, Petersham, Paxton, Greenfield, Worcester, Hubbardston, Oakham, Gill, Montague, Wendell, and New Salem - bringing the total to 167/351.</p>
