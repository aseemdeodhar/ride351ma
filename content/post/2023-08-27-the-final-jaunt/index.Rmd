This route (or slight variations thereof) had been part of the original 'plan' where I had mapped out multiple routes at the beginning of this challenge connecting points in the Berkshire (Pittsfield, Lee, Lenox, Williamstown) and Pioneer (Greenfield, Northampton, Springfield) Valleys which are transit hubs. However, I never really made it out here until now - when these towns were the last five left on the challenge.

Overall, I covered 5 new towns - Russell, Blandford, Otis, Tyringham, and Monterey - bringing the total to 351/351 - 100.0%!
